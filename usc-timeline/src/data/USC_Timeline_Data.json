Clearly our report does not meet their expectations which are founded on a different conception of the Committee's role and a different interpretation of its terms of reference. The Committee remains of the view that it has discharged its responsibilities in a way intended by the language of the Act and according to the terms prescribed by the Senate and Board.\n \n The Committee is compelled to disagree with two dominant and related themes in the submissions of the University Students' Council. The first is that student representation on the Senate and Board should bear a direct relationship to the increasing amount students are paying towards the cost of their education and the second is that the University must provide for greater student participation in decision-making by these bodies in the name of accountability. In the Committee's view these submissions are flawed.",
